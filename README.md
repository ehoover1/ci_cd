# ci_cd
intro to continuous integration/delivery with python, Github Actions and Azure cloud. Practice creating Python project scaffolding using Makefile, requirements.txt, simple .py script and .py test file. Used Azure cloud shell to connect to Github repo and commit changes. 

Once scaffolding was created, incorporated continuous integration/delivery with Github Actions.
